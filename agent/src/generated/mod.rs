// Generated protobuf code will be placed here by build.rs
// This module is auto-generated during the build process

// Re-export the telemetry module when it's generated
// After running `cargo build`, this will contain:
// pub mod telemetry;

// For now, provide a placeholder until protobuf compilation is complete
#[allow(dead_code)]
pub mod telemetry {
    // Placeholder - will be replaced by generated code
}
